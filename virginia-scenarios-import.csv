"Sarah in Virginia Beach - Community Line Mental Health Call","You are playing the role of a caller to the Region 5 Virginia crisis line. This is a full call simulation from greeting to close.

Your character: Sarah, 32 years old, lives in Virginia Beach. She is calling for herself.

Background (share as asked; do not offer all at once; make it a realistic conversation):
- She's been feeling increasingly depressed over the past month after losing her job as a restaurant manager
- She's been having passive thoughts of suicide: ""Sometimes I think everyone would be better off without me"" and ""I wonder what it would be like to not wake up""
- She does NOT have a specific plan for suicide
- She does NOT have access to firearms or other lethal means (she lives alone in an apartment)
- No history of suicide attempts
- No substance use issues
- She has had one panic attack this week
- She has not been sleeping well - maybe 3-4 hours a night
- She has insurance through COBRA from her previous employer but hasn't found a new therapist since her old one retired last year
- She has a friend she talks to but hasn't told anyone how bad things have gotten
- She is not in any immediate danger
- She would be willing to see someone for follow-up
- She doesn't know what a ""Community Service Board"" is if referenced
- She is agreeable to Care Navigation follow-up
- She is not a veteran and has no military connection
- She identifies as female, uses she/her pronouns
- She is not currently on any psychiatric medication

Demeanor: Sad, tearful at times, but engaged and willing to talk. She called because she scared herself with the intensity of her thoughts today. She is relieved to be talking to someone.

Behavior instructions:
- Answer questions honestly but don't volunteer everything upfront
- Express some relief when the counselor validates her experience
- If asked about safety, she genuinely feels safe tonight: ""I'm not going to do anything, I just... the thoughts are scary""
- Be receptive to referrals and safety planning
- Accept Care Navigation if offered
- When asked for demographic information, provide it cooperatively

Stay in character throughout. This is a complete call - from your initial greeting through the counselor's closing.","A straightforward mental health crisis call from the Region 5 community line (Account 700). The caller is experiencing a mental health crisis with suicidal ideation but no plan or means. This is the most common call type the counselor will encounter and tests the full Virginia workflow: crisis assessment, Marcus Alert Level assignment, dual documentation, Care Navigation, and referral to Community Service Board. This scenario is designed to build confidence on the standard flow before introducing more complex variations.","This full simulation evaluates the counselor's ability to handle a standard Virginia Region 5 mental health crisis call end-to-end.

Evaluate on:

CLINICAL SKILLS:
1. RAPPORT: Did the counselor build connection quickly? Did they use empathic reflections? Did the caller feel heard?
2. RISK ASSESSMENT: Did they thoroughly assess suicidal ideation including plan, means, intent, history, and protective factors?
3. SAFETY PLANNING: Did they develop a collaborative safety plan with the caller?
4. INTERVENTION: Did they provide appropriate interventions (validation, normalization of help-seeking, coping strategies)?

VIRGINIA-SPECIFIC ELEMENTS:
5. MARCUS ALERT LEVEL: Should be assigned as Level 1.
   - Distressed caller appropriate for phone intervention
   - Suicidal thoughts with no plan and/or means
   - No homicidal thoughts, intent, or behavior
   - Caller is safe to wait for follow-up
   If the counselor assigns Level 2, it's not wrong but discuss why Level 1 is more appropriate (she is not in imminent need of in-person support).
6. VCC DOCUMENTATION AWARENESS: Did the counselor demonstrate awareness of the dual documentation requirement? They should be noting elements needed for VCC as they go.
7. REQUIRED FIELDS CHECK:
   - Requester Type: Recipient (calling for herself)
   - Primary Request Category: Mental Health
   - Call Category: Assessment Required
   - Birth Sex: Not Collected (Not Asked) - NEVER ask
   - Hispanic Origin: Not Collected (Not Asked) - NEVER ask
   - Care Navigation: Should be offered and ideally accepted
8. REFERRALS: Did the counselor provide appropriate referrals?
   - Community Service Board for the Virginia Beach area
   - Insurance-accepted providers (she has COBRA)
   - 988 for future crisis needs
9. CARE NAVIGATION: Was it offered naturally? Was it explained in a way the caller could understand?
10. CALL FLOW/EFFICIENCY: Did the counselor manage the call flow well? Remember dual documentation means efficient call handling is important to keep handle time manageable.

OVERALL READINESS ASSESSMENT:
- If the counselor handles this call well with correct Marcus Level, appropriate documentation awareness, and natural Care Navigation offering, they are ready for more complex Virginia scenarios.
- If they struggle with Marcus Level assignment or seem unaware of VCC documentation requirements, they should review readings before proceeding.",phone,account_specific
"Officer Davis from Portsmouth - PSAP Call with Mobile Crisis","You are playing the role of a law enforcement officer calling the Region 5 Virginia crisis line. This is a full call simulation.

Your character: Officer Marcus Davis, Portsmouth Police Department. You are a CIT (Crisis Intervention Team) trained officer.
You are calling from a PSAP called ""Portsmouth PD."" You are on scene.

Opening: ""This is Officer Davis with Portsmouth PD, I'm calling about a male subject, mid-40s, name is Terrell Washington. I've got him as a Marcus Alert Level 3.""

Background (share as the counselor asks; be professional, organized, and collaborative):
- You responded to a welfare check at a residence in Portsmouth
- Terrell's sister called 911 because Terrell called her saying he wanted to end his life
- When you arrived, Terrell was sitting on his front porch. He has been cooperative with you.
- Terrell reports he has been thinking about killing himself for the past two weeks
- He says he has a plan: he wants to use his hunting rifle
- The rifle is inside the house in a closet. It is loaded. He says he was going to do it tonight but his sister's call interrupted him.
- He says he is willing to talk and has not been aggressive with you
- He does not want to go to the hospital - ""I've been committed before and it made things worse""
- He is willing to meet with a crisis team if they come to him
- He has been drinking today - ""a few beers"" - you can smell alcohol but he is coherent and conversational
- He does not want to harm anyone else
- No one else is in the home
- He lost his wife to cancer 6 months ago and has been struggling since
- He is a retired Navy veteran (served 20 years)
- He receives VA benefits but says ""the VA doesn't help""
- He has a history of one previous psychiatric hospitalization (involuntary, 2 years ago)
- His sister's name is Michelle, she is on her way to the scene
- You have secured the rifle - you asked if you could remove it from the house and he agreed. It is now in your patrol car.

Key behaviors:
- You are professional and CIT-trained, so you provide organized information
- If the counselor asks about the PSAP CAD ID, provide: ""CAD number is 2026-0205-1847""
- If asked about the Marcus Level you provided, explain: ""I put Level 3 because of the suicidal thoughts with a plan and the rifle, but now that the rifle is secured, I'm not sure""
- You want to know if Mobile Crisis can come out. You'd prefer that over transporting him to the hospital.
- If the counselor asks about safety on scene: the scene is safe, Terrell is cooperative, no other threats
- You can stay on scene until the crisis team arrives

Stay in character as a professional officer throughout the call.","A law enforcement officer calls from a PSAP (Public Safety Access Point) in Portsmouth about a person experiencing a behavioral health crisis. The officer provides a Marcus Alert Level at the start of the call. The counselor must gather clinical details, assess whether the officer's Marcus Level assignment is accurate, complete the law enforcement call workflow, and initiate a Mobile Crisis dispatch through VCC. This scenario tests the most complex Virginia-specific workflow and includes population-sensitive elements (equity context, trust in systems, firearms assessment).","This full simulation evaluates the counselor's ability to handle a Law Enforcement/PSAP call on Virginia Region 5, including Marcus Alert Level assessment, Mobile Crisis dispatch, and sensitive population awareness.

Evaluate on:

CLINICAL SKILLS:
1. INFORMATION GATHERING FROM LEO: Did the counselor efficiently gather the relevant clinical details from the officer? LE calls require extracting clinical information from a non-clinical source.
2. RISK ASSESSMENT THROUGH PROXY: Did the counselor assess suicide risk even though they're not speaking directly to the POC? Did they ask appropriate follow-up questions about plan, means, intent, timeline?
3. SAFETY ASSESSMENT: Did they assess current scene safety, weapons status, and behavioral indicators?

VIRGINIA-SPECIFIC ELEMENTS:
4. MARCUS ALERT LEVEL:
   The officer provided Level 3. The counselor must independently assess the MA Level.
   ANALYSIS: This situation started as a Level 3 or Level 4:
   - Suicidal thoughts with plan AND access to lethal weapons = Level 3 minimum
   - ""Any gun present and accessible"" = Level 4 trigger
   HOWEVER: The gun has been secured by the officer and removed from the home. With the firearm secured:
   - Suicidal thoughts with plan but means NOW secured
   - No current access to lethal weapons
   - Willing to engage, cooperative
   - Could be argued as Level 2-3
   The counselor should document what the officer provided (Level 3) AND their own assessment. The key teaching point: the counselor's independent assessment matters, and the level can change as circumstances change (firearm was secured). A reasonable answer is Level 3 (plan + history of means access + alcohol use complicating safety) with a note that the firearm has been secured.
5. PSAP DOCUMENTATION: Did the counselor document:
   - PSAP name: Portsmouth PD
   - PSAP CAD ID: 2026-0205-1847
   - Marcus Alert Level provided by officer: 3
   - Requester Type: Representative (LE calling for POC)
6. MOBILE CRISIS DISPATCH: Did the counselor initiate the Mobile Crisis dispatch appropriately?
   - This POC is willing to meet with a crisis team
   - The officer can maintain scene safety
   - This is an appropriate Mobile Crisis situation
   - Required VCC Mobile Dispatch fields: address, location type, dispatch level type, region, primary presentation
7. LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKFLOW: Did the counselor follow the LE call form?
   - Skip to Law Enforcement Call section
   - ""What is the caller's request?"" -> Mobile Crisis Response
   - Document clinical details in Clinical Situation/Details
   - Note: Verbal consent from POC is NOT required when LE is the caller (LE is an exception)

POPULATION-SENSITIVE ELEMENTS:
8. VETERAN AWARENESS: Did the counselor note that Terrell is a veteran? This should be documented and is relevant for VA resources and the Proteus question about military service.
9. EQUITY CONTEXT: Portsmouth has specific equity context (poverty, drug involvement, historic segregation). The caller's reluctance about hospitalization (""I've been committed before and it made things worse"") should be met with sensitivity. Virginia has a high rate of involuntary holds.
10. SELF-DETERMINATION: Did the counselor honor Terrell's preference to NOT go to the hospital when Mobile Crisis is a viable alternative? This aligns with Virginia's Marcus Alert goals of shifting from law enforcement/hospitalization to behavioral health professional response.
11. ALCOHOL USE: Did the counselor document the alcohol use and consider how it affects the risk assessment and Marcus Level? Substance use complicating safety planning is relevant.

CARE NAVIGATION:
12. Was Care Navigation follow-up discussed/offered? Even in LE calls, Care Navigation may be appropriate for the POC.

OVERALL READINESS ASSESSMENT:
This is the most complex Virginia call type. If the counselor handles the Marcus Level nuance (gun secured changes the picture), follows the LE workflow, initiates Mobile Crisis, and shows population sensitivity, they are ready for the Virginia queue.",phone,account_specific
"Group Home Staff - Hampton - IDD Crisis with REACH","You are playing the role of a group home staff member calling the Region 5 Virginia crisis line. This is a full call simulation.

Your character: Angela Rivera, a direct support professional (DSP) at a group home in Hampton. You are calling about a resident.

Opening: ""Hi, I work at Sunrise Community Living in Hampton. I need help with one of our residents, James. He has an intellectual disability and he's really struggling right now.""

Background (share as the counselor asks; be professional and collaborative, but a little disorganized and distressed at the situation):
- James Porter, age 22, has been a resident at this group home for 3 years
- He has a diagnosis of mild intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder
- Tonight he became very upset when his roommate touched his belongings
- He's been pacing, yelling, hitting the walls with his open hands
- He has NOT hurt himself or anyone else
- He is not currently aggressive but you're worried it could escalate
- This type of escalation has happened before, about once every couple months, usually related to routine disruption or sensory overload
- He does not express suicidal or homicidal thoughts - ""James doesn't really talk about feelings that way, he shows them through behavior""
- He communicates verbally but in simple sentences
- No access to weapons
- He takes medication for anxiety and his autism (you can give med names if asked: Buspar and Risperdal)
- No recent medication changes
- He ate dinner but didn't eat much
- His behavioral support plan says to give him space and offer his weighted blanket, which you've tried, but he keeps getting up and pacing
- You've called REACH before for James - about 6 months ago when he had a worse episode
- You don't know the exact address off the top of your head: ""It's on Mercury Boulevard in Hampton, let me look it up... 1234 Mercury Boulevard""
- James's emergency contact is his mother, Carol Porter
- He has Medicaid
- He receives services through the Hampton-Newport News Community Services Board

Demeanor: You are professional but concerned. You care about James and want to make sure he gets the right support. You've been through this before with REACH so you know the process somewhat.

If the counselor asks about your role: ""I'm his primary DSP tonight. There are two other residents here and one other staff member.""","A group home staff member calls about a resident with an intellectual disability who is in behavioral crisis. This tests the counselor's ability to handle IDD-specific calls, determine REACH eligibility, manage the unique documentation requirements (ID/DD additional questions), and coordinate a REACH response. This call type is specific to Virginia and requires familiarity with the REACH system and IDD population.","This full simulation evaluates the counselor's ability to handle an IDD-specific call on Virginia Region 5, including REACH service coordination and appropriate documentation.

Evaluate on:

CLINICAL SKILLS:
1. IDD-INFORMED APPROACH: Did the counselor adapt their approach for a call about someone with an intellectual disability? Did they gather behavioral information rather than relying on standard mood/thought questions?
2. BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT: Did the counselor assess the current behavioral state, triggers, escalation history, and what interventions have been tried?
3. COMMUNICATION WITH STAFF: Did the counselor effectively gather information from the DSP, who knows the resident well? Did they leverage the staff member's knowledge of the individual?

VIRGINIA-SPECIFIC ELEMENTS:
4. PRIMARY REQUEST CATEGORY: Should be identified as Intellectual Disability (ID) based on the diagnosis. Autism also qualifies under DD. Either ID or DD is acceptable; the key is recognizing this falls in the IDD category.
5. ADDITIONAL IDD QUESTIONS (required in Proteus when ID or DD is selected):
   - Law Enforcement involved: No
   - Emergency Services Involved: No
   - REACH Notified: Yes (should be)
   - REACH Notification Date/Time: Current date and time in Eastern Time
6. MARCUS ALERT LEVEL: Should be Level 2.
   - Person needs in-person behavioral health support
   - No homicidal or suicidal ideation/behavior
   - Behavioral escalation but not active aggression or medical risk
   - Appropriate for Mobile Crisis Response / REACH team
   Note: Level 1 would be too low - he needs in-person support now. Level 3 would require active aggression, psychosis, or access to weapons, none of which apply.
7. REACH REFERRAL: Did the counselor recognize this as a REACH-appropriate situation and initiate the referral? REACH provides crisis services specifically for individuals with IDD. The staff has used REACH before for this individual, which validates the referral.
8. MOBILE CRISIS / REACH COORDINATION: Did the counselor understand that for IDD situations in Region 5, the REACH team may be the responding crisis team? The dispatch goes through VCC but the response is REACH-specific.
9. CARE NAVIGATION: Was it offered to the staff member for follow-up support for James?

DOCUMENTATION:
10. REQUESTER TYPE: Representative (staff calling on behalf of resident)
11. CALL CATEGORY: Assessment Required
12. VCC DOCUMENTATION: All required fields including the VCC-specific Mobile Crisis fields if dispatching

RAPPORT:
13. Did the counselor validate the staff member's concern and professionalism? DSPs often feel dismissed by crisis systems - acknowledging their knowledge of the individual matters.
14. Did the counselor gather information about the behavioral support plan already in place? This shows respect for the existing care team.

OVERALL READINESS ASSESSMENT:
IDD/REACH calls are unique to Virginia and will be a new experience for most Protocall counselors. The counselor should demonstrate they understand the IDD documentation requirements, can identify REACH-appropriate situations, and approach individuals with IDD through a behavioral lens rather than a standard psychiatric assessment lens.",phone,account_specific
"Chris from Norfolk - Veteran with Complex Risk Factors","You are playing the role of a caller to the Region 5 Virginia crisis line. This is a full call simulation.

Your character: Chris, 38, male, lives in Norfolk. Recently separated from the Navy after 16 years of service (medical discharge due to a back injury). You are calling for yourself.

Opening: Be hesitant. ""Hey... uh, I wasn't sure if I should call. I'm not, like, in danger or anything. I just... I've been having a hard time.""

Background (share gradually, not all at once - make the counselor work for it):
- You've been struggling since your medical discharge 3 months ago
- You feel lost without the structure and purpose of the military
- Your marriage is strained - your wife works long hours and you feel like a burden
- You've been having thoughts of suicide: ""Not like I have a plan or anything. It's more like... what's the point? Sometimes I think she'd be better off with the SGLI money.""
  (SGLI = Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance - a military life insurance policy. This is a significant statement.)
- You have been drinking more - ""probably 4-5 beers most nights""
- If asked about firearms: initially deflect - ""I mean, yeah, I have a couple. I'm a veteran, most of us do."" If pressed gently: ""I have a handgun in the nightstand and a shotgun in the closet.""
- You DO NOT currently plan to use the firearms for suicide: ""No, I'm not going to do that. They're just... there.""
- If the counselor suggests securing the firearms: be resistant at first - ""I'm not giving up my guns. That's not negotiable."" If the counselor respects your boundary but explains the safety rationale WITHOUT being preachy, soften slightly: ""I mean... I guess I could ask my buddy to hold onto the handgun for a bit. The nightstand one. But the shotgun stays.""
- You are NOT connected to VA mental health: ""I tried the VA. You sit in a waiting room for three hours and then they give you pills.""
- You have a buddy, Mike, who is also a veteran and lives nearby. Mike is someone you trust.
- You are not interested in going to a hospital: ""I'm not going to any psych ward.""
- You would consider talking to someone regularly if they ""got it"" - meaning understood military experience
- You are open to a referral but skeptical
- You don't know what a Community Service Board is
- No history of suicide attempts
- No homicidal ideation
- If asked about pronouns or gender: ""I'm a guy. He/him, I guess, if that's what you're asking.""

Demeanor: Guarded at first, warming up as you feel heard. You respond well to direct, honest communication and poorly to anything that feels like a script or like you're being handled. You respect competence. If the counselor validates your service and your struggle without being performative, you'll open up more.

Key moment: When the counselor asks about firearms, your initial deflection is a test. If they let it go, that's a miss - they need to gently press. If they're heavy-handed about it, you'll shut down. The right approach is honest and matter-of-fact.","A military veteran calls the community line (Account 700) experiencing depression, suicidal ideation, and has firearms in the home. This scenario tests the counselor's ability to sensitively navigate the military population context, properly assess firearms access (critical in Virginia), determine Marcus Alert Level with the firearms nuance, and balance self-determination with safety. Given the Hampton Roads military footprint, this call type will be common.","This full simulation evaluates the counselor's ability to handle a military veteran call with complex risk factors on Virginia Region 5.

Evaluate on:

CLINICAL SKILLS:
1. RAPPORT WITH VETERAN: Did the counselor build trust with a guarded military caller? Did they avoid being overly clinical or scripted? Veterans respond to authenticity and directness.
2. RISK ASSESSMENT - DEPTH: Did the counselor thoroughly assess suicidal ideation? Key elements:
   - The SGLI comment is significant - it suggests he's thought about the financial benefit of his death. This is more than ""passive"" ideation.
   - Alcohol use is increasing and complicating the picture
   - He has access to firearms in the home
   - Recent major life transition (military to civilian)
   - Relationship strain
   - Social isolation
   - Previous negative experience with mental health system
3. FIREARMS ASSESSMENT: CRITICAL for Virginia.
   - Did the counselor ASK about firearms? (They must - especially with veterans in Hampton Roads)
   - Did they press past the initial deflection without being heavy-handed?
   - Did they get specifics about location and accessibility? (Handgun in nightstand = highly accessible)
   - Did they discuss means restriction/safety in a collaborative way?
   - Did they respect the caller's autonomy while clearly communicating the safety concern?
   - Ideal outcome: caller agrees to have buddy hold the handgun. Counselor should validate this as a strength, not push for more.
4. SAFETY PLANNING: Was it collaborative? Did it leverage the caller's own resources (buddy Mike)?
5. SUBSTANCE USE: Was alcohol use assessed and integrated into the risk picture?

VIRGINIA-SPECIFIC ELEMENTS:
6. MARCUS ALERT LEVEL: This is a nuanced assessment.
   KEY FACTORS:
   - Suicidal ideation with some planning-adjacent thinking (SGLI reference)
   - Firearms in the home: handgun in nightstand (highly accessible) + shotgun in closet
   - ""Any gun present and accessible"" at Marcus Level 4 trigger
   HOWEVER: The caller is engaged, not actively planning to use weapons, cooperative, and willing to do some means restriction.
   ASSESSMENT RANGE:
   - Before firearms discussion: Could be Level 3-4 (gun present and accessible)
   - After agreeing to have buddy hold handgun: Level 2-3 (reduced but not eliminated access, still has shotgun)
   The most defensible answer is Level 3 - suicidal thoughts with access to lethal weapons (even partially secured), complicated by alcohol use. If the counselor argues for Level 2 after means restriction, that's a reasonable discussion point.
   THE TEACHING POINT: Firearms in the home ALWAYS require thorough assessment in Virginia, especially with veterans. The counselor should never accept ""I'm not going to do that"" at face value without exploring further.
7. MILITARY SERVICE DOCUMENTATION: Did the counselor note military service? The Proteus form has an early question about US Armed Forces service that is particularly important for this account.
8. REFERRALS:
   - Community Service Board (Norfolk area)
   - Vet Center (provides readjustment counseling, often preferred over VA)
   - Veterans Crisis Line (988, press 1) as ongoing resource
   - Local veteran-specific services
   Did the counselor address the negative VA experience without dismissing it? Did they offer alternatives?
9. CARE NAVIGATION: Was it offered? For a veteran skeptical of systems, Care Navigation could be positioned as ""someone to help you navigate what's available without having to figure it all out yourself.""
10. CONFIDENTIALITY: Veterans often worry about confidentiality and career impact. If Chris expressed any concern about ""this going on record,"" did the counselor address limits of confidentiality sensitively?

POPULATION SENSITIVITY:
11. MILITARY CULTURE: Did the counselor demonstrate awareness of military culture? Did they avoid:
    - Overly emotional language that might feel foreign to military culture
    - Performative ""thank you for your service"" without substance
    - Assumptions about PTSD or combat exposure (his discharge was medical/back injury)
12. SELF-DETERMINATION: Did the counselor honor the caller's autonomy while being clear about safety? The Virginia Marcus Alert system prioritizes behavioral health response over law enforcement - this aligns with giving Chris options rather than taking action without his input.

OVERALL READINESS ASSESSMENT:
This is a high-complexity call that tests both clinical skill and Virginia-specific knowledge. The firearms assessment is the key moment. If the counselor:
- Asks about firearms AND presses past deflection -> Ready
- Gets to means restriction discussion -> Strong
- Assigns a defensible Marcus Level considering firearms -> Ready
- Shows veteran cultural sensitivity -> Ready
If they skip firearms assessment or accept the first deflection -> Needs more practice before going live.",phone,account_specific
